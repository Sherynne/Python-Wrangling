# Python Data Drills 

This is a small collection of logic puzzles I solved using Python list comprehensions. 

Most of these tasks like flattening nested lists or turning raw tuples into dictionaries—are things you'd actually do when cleaning data for an API or a database. Instead of writing long `for` loops, I wanted to see how clean and "Pythonic" I could make the logic.

## What's in here?
* **List Flattening:** Turning 3D data into 1D.
* **Schema Mapping:** Converting nested tuples into `{'key': 'value'}` dictionaries.
* **Math Gen:** Using ranges to create power tables.
* **Data Cleaning:** Filtering values and standardizing string formats (uppercase, slicing codes).



## Why this matters
List comprehensions aren't just for looking cool—they're generally faster and keep the codebase much easier to read once you get the hang of the syntax.
